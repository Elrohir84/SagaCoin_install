#paranoidtruth BOXY GUIDE for windows-linux (cold) setup
#you do need a linux vps to get a public IP, etc.  If you don't know what that is, you might want to hold off on this.


***************************** LINUX VPS setup (part 1) *************************************************************
#I personally use a fairly small linux instance, 1024memory, ubuntu, 16.04
#a lot of people use vultr, the $5 instance.  but any vps will do.  
Stick with ubuntu 16.04 for this guide, though.
#there are tons of vps services like: ovh, vpsdime, vultr, digitalocean, etc, etc.
#get the vps ip they gave you, you will need that for the windows setup
********************************************************************************************************************


*************************** WINDOWS SETUP (or mac) *****************************************************************
#side note, you actually need a little over 10000 coins because there's a trans fee.  
#If you literally have only 10000, go buy one more coin.
#send all coins from exchange to your local windows/mac wallet primary/default wallet address

#edit your local (windows/mac) boxycoin.conf file
#it should be at /users/<your user name>/AppData/Roaming/boxycoin
#or in mac: /Users/<username>/Library/Application Support/boxycoin
#it can be virtually empty, we will mainly add the staking=0 & addnodes
#it should look like this:
staking=0
addnode=159.203.161.244:21524
addnode=178.62.57.88:21524
addnode=37.187.140.168:21524
addnode=138.68.104.158:21524
addnode=212.73.150.141:21524

#SAVE, shutdown & restart wallet to load those new configs
#make sure the wallet is unlocked

Go to the RECEIVE tab (File -> receiving addresses)
Create a new address, label it MN1
Send exactly 10000 coins to that address.  You are just sending coins to yourself at a secondary wallet address. 
ONE TRANSACTION.  EXACTLY 10000.  Do NOT add in extra!
Wait for a few confirms in the transactions tab, the full amount won’t show, but the fee will.

Open the console: Tools->debug console
Type: masternode outputs
You should get output that looks something like this:
"xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" : "0"
Copy & save this to a file, you will need in a minute.
The first part is your txid.  The second part is your index.  

If that didn’t work, stop, you’re already broken.  
Did you send exactly 10000 coins? 10000.01 is not 10000, most common mistake is people send extra.  
Your primary can have the extra, your MN needs exactly 10000.   

In the debug console, type:
masternode genkey
copy/save that output to a file.  Don’t lose it, you will need it for the VPS setup
You will be using the genkey & txid in just a minute for window masternode.conf...

#now need to edit the masternode.conf file
#make it look EXACTLY like this, it's just one line. use your actual vps_ip, genkey, tx_id & index num
MN1 VPS_IP:21524 your_genkey_here your_tx_id_here index_num_here

#save it.  close wallet & reopen to reload configs again.
go back to debug: Tools->debug console
#double check config:
masternode list-conf
#verify data there looks good for the ip addr, txid, priv/genkey, etc.
#verify it matches for the tx id and index:
masternode outputs

***************************** LINUX VPS setup (part 2) *************************************************************
#SSH into the vps (most windows users will use putty.  If you're not familiar with putty, watch a quick youtube vid)
#If you're on a mac you have a built in SSH terminal instead of putty)
#after connecting should see something like: root@whatever_your_server_name_is
#copy all instructions one line at a time:

######################## OPTIONAL ADD USER ###########################
#this is OPTIONAL, but I do not like to install as root.
You can skip the next few user lines if you want to install as root
#so let's create a user called boxy1
#it's going to ask you questions like room number, you can just hit enter for all those, all you really need to fill in 
#is the new user password, do not lose this password either, you need both the root & boxy1 password from now on

adduser boxy1

#now give this user sudo access (more power!)
usermod -aG sudo boxy1

#switch to out new user:
su - boxy1
#you are now logged in as boxy1
############### END OF OPTIONAL ADD USER ###############################

cd ~/

#now download and run the install script:
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paranoidtruth/SagaCoin_install/master/boxy_install.sh
sudo chmod +x boxy_install.sh
#you will now need that masternodeprivkey from windoows, 
#copy it, right click to paste when asked for it
sh boxy_install.sh
#enter y at the end to enable firewall

#after finishes, run:
boxycoin-cli getmininginfo
#you should see the block number, and run that command every couple minutes
#until you sync up to the current block.  Then you should be ready to continue:

#see if we are running: 
boxycoin-cli masternode status
#you want to see status 9.  ignore the "could not find suitable coins"

#now, let's also see if we can see our ip in the list, swap in YOUR txid from windows for xxxx
boxycoin-cli masternode list | grep xxxx
#with any luck you will see something like: xxxx : ENABLED,

#what if that didn't all work?
#DEBUG RULES:
#wait 5 min, then restart vps wallet & try again:
boxycoind stop
#wait a few seconds:
boxycoind 
#test again using the grep technique above
#verify your vps wallet is in sync on blockchain to current block number:
boxycoin-cli getmininginfo
#see if block number there matches current block count in the boxy block explorer:

#if sync'd and still not in list, go back to windows and shut-down, restart wallet.
#Do all of the following in the windows wallet debug/console:
masternode start-alias MN1 (use whatever you named your MN)
#verify yours is enabled in: 
masternode list
#If everything is good there, try again in LINUX VPS, use the grep command again
#if it's still not good, stop and restart it in the VPS:
boxycoin-cli stop #stop
boxycoind	#restart
#still not good?  Wait 5 min and repeat all debug steps.

#FYI: some VPS commands you might use on occasion:
boxycoind #starts
boxycoin-cli masternode list #shows all nodes
boxycoin-cli stop #stops
boxycoin-cli getmininginfo #show blocks, etc.
boxycoin-cli help #shows every possible command

#WINDOWS CMD:
masternode list-conf
masternode outputs
masternode list

#wait for rewards.  First one might take up to 24+ hours.
#I also recommend (full disclosure, it's mine) the monitoring feature of mnode.club

#You can create an acct and add your node to your watchlist to get email alerts 
#if the node goes down, or for any incoming reward pmt.
#add your node to your watchlist!
