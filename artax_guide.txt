#paranoidtruth ARTAX GUIDE for windows-linux (cold) setup
#you do need a linux vps to get a public IP, etc.  If you don't know what that is, you might want to hold off on this.

***************************** LINUX VPS setup (part 1) *************************************************************
#I personally use a fairly small linux instance, 1024memory, ubuntu, 16.04
#a lot of people use vultr, the $5 instance.  but any vps will do.  
Stick with ubuntu 16.04 for this guide, though.
#there are tons of vps services like: ovh, vpsdime, vultr, digitalocean, etc, etc.
#get the vps ip they gave you, you will need that for the windows setup
********************************************************************************************************************


*************************** WINDOWS SETUP (or mac) *****************************************************************
#side note, you actually need a little over 2500 coins because there's a trans fee.  
#If you literally have only 2500, go buy one more coin.
#send all coins from exchange to your local windows/mac wallet primary/default wallet address

#edit your local (windows/mac) artax.conf file
#it should be at /users/<your user name>/AppData/Roaming/Artax
#or in mac: /Users/<username>/Library/Application Support/Artax
#it can be virtually empty, we will mainly add the staking=0 & addnodes
#it should look like this:
staking=0
addnode=artax.online 
addnode=seed1.artax.one 
addnode=seed2.artax.one 
addnode=seed3.artax.one 
addnode=104.207.156.30:34457
addnode=108.51.164.90:56635
addnode=108.51.88.251:60423
addnode=108.61.181.58:43427
addnode=108.61.215.152:21527
addnode=113.161.8.131:53080
addnode=115.75.5.106:63112
addnode=124.121.188.118:56878

#SAVE, shutdown & restart wallet to load those new configs
#There's really only a couple more steps on the windows side.
#make sure the wallet is unlocked

Go to the RECEIVE tab
Create a new address, label it MN1.
Send exactly 2500 coins to that address.  You are just sending coins to yourself at a secondary wallet address. 
ONE TRANSACTION.  EXACTLY 2500.  Do NOT add in extra!
Wait for a few confirms in the transactions tab, the full amount won’t show, but the fee will.

Open the console: Help->debug window->console.
Type: masternode outputs
You should get output that looks something like this:
"xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" : "0"
Copy & save this to a file, you will need in a minute.
The first part is your txid.  The second part is your index.  

If that didn’t work, stop, you’re already broken.  
Did you send exactly 2500 coins? 2500.01 is not 2500, most common mistake is people send extra.  
Your primary can have the extra, your MN needs exactly 2500.   

In the debug console, type:
masternode genkey
copy/save that output to a file.  Don’t lose it, you will need it for the VPS setup
You will be using the genkey & txid in just a minute for window masternode.conf...

#go to masternodes tab & create one.
#Alias: that's just MN1 or whatever you want to call it.
#Address: use your VPS ip & port: xx.xx.xx.xx:21527
#PrivKey: that is the masternode genkey you just created a few minutes ago
#TxHash: that is the characters from masternode outputs you did a few minutes ago
#Output Index: is the number, probably 0, from masternode outputs
#Leave Reward Addr & the % blank, just let your rewards go to our MN address
#create it.  That just created a masternode.conf file in the same location as your primary conf file
#you can manually edit it later using notepad if needed.
#close wallet & reopen to reload configs again.
go back to debug: Help->debug window->console
#double check config:
masternode list-conf
#verify data there looks good for the ip addr, txid, priv/genkey, etc.

***************************** LINUX VPS setup (part 2) *************************************************************
#SSH into the vps (most windows users will use putty.  If you're not familiar with putty, watch a quick youtube vid)
#If you're on a mac you have a built in SSH terminal instead of putty)
#after connecting should see something like: root@whatever_your_server_name_is
#copy all instructions one line at a time:

#first we will create a new user, we do not want to install as root
#so let's create a user called artax1
#it's going to ask you questions like room number, you can just hit enter for all those, all you really need to fill in 
#is the new user password, do not lose this password either, you need both the root & artax1 password from now on

adduser artax1

#now give this user sudo access (more power!)
usermod -aG sudo artax1

#switch to out new user:
su - artax1
#you are now logged in as artax1
cd ~/

#now download and run the install script:
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paranoidtruth/SagaCoin_install/master/artax_install.sh
sudo chmod +x artax_install.sh
#you will now need that masternodeprivkey from windoows, 
#copy it, right click to paste when asked for it
sh artax_install.sh
#enter y at the end to enable firewall

#after finishes, run:
artaxd getmininginfo
#you should see the block number, and run that command every couple minutes
#until you sync up to the current block.  Then you should be ready to continue:

#see if we are running: 
artaxd masternode status
#you want to see status 9.  ignore the "could not find suitable coins"

#now, let's also see if we can see our ip in the list, swap in YOUR txid from windows for xxxx
artaxd masternode list | grep xxxx
#with any luck you will see something like: xx.xx.xx.xx:21527 : ENABLED,

#what if that didn't all work?
#DEBUG RULES:
#wait 5 min, then restart vps wallet & try again:
artaxd stop
artaxd 
#test again using the grep technique above
#verify your vps wallet is in sync on blockchain to current block number:
artaxd getmininginfo
#see if block number there matches current block count in explorer:
#http://104.131.44.238:3001/

#if sync'd and still not in list, go back to windows and shut-down, restart wallet.
#Do all of the following in the windows wallet debug/console:
masternode start-alias MN1 (use whatever you named your MN)
#verify yours is enabled in: 
masternode list
#If everything is good there, try again in LINUX VPS, use the grep command again
#if it's still not good, stop and restart it in the VPS:
artaxd stop #stop
artaxd	#restart
#still not good?  Wait 5 min and repeat all debug steps.


#FYI: some VPS commands you might use on occasion:
artaxd #starts
artaxd masternode list #shows all nodes
artaxd stop #stops
artaxd getmininginfo #show blocks, etc.
artaxd help #shows every possible command

#WINDOWS CMD:
masternode outputs
masternode list full #and find yours

#wait for rewards.  First one might take up to 24+ hours.
#I also recommend (full disclosure, it's mine) the monitoring feature of mnode.club
https://mnode.club/g/nodes/ARTX/

#You can create an acct and add your node to your watchlist to get email alerts 
#if the node goes down, or for any incoming reward pmt.
#add it to your account watchlist.
